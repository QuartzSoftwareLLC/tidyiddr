When downloading data from the internet, it is often useful to cache the data so that you do not have to download it again each time you run your script.
Normally, this has to be done manually by saving your file to a local downloads directory.
`tidyiddr` has built in support for cache mangement.
All downloads in `tidyiddr` are built on top of the `cache_download()` function.
